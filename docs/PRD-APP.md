# PRD: Link Shortener with Analytics (SaaS Template Reference App)

## 1. Product Summary
- **Problem**: Early-stage SaaS teams need a working product skeleton to validate the template, demo monetization, and test GTM motions without building a full stack from scratch.
- **Solution**: A link shortener with analytics that demonstrates the SaaS template’s end-to-end capabilities: marketing site, auth, multi-tenant org model, RBAC, billing, feature usage, and analytics.
- **Value Proposition**: Showcase a cohesive, modular product that can be adapted to other micro-SaaS ideas while remaining production-ready.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals
### 2.1 Goals
- Validate the template covers the complete SaaS lifecycle from acquisition to monetization.
- Ship an opinionated but easily replaceable feature module (link shortener).
- Provide guided flows that make it easy to demo or onboard template adopters.
- Instrument analytics to prove value (click tracking, usage dashboards).

### 2.2 Non-Goals
- Building a best-in-class link intelligence product (focus is breadth, not depth).
- Supporting enterprise SSO, advanced RBAC, or custom billing logic.
- Delivering a native mobile experience (web-first only).

## 3. Target Users and Personas
- **Anonymous Visitor** (Marketing/Growth): Consumes the landing page, compares pricing, and enters the signup funnel.
- **Member (Org User)**: Creates and manages short links, reviews analytics to optimize campaigns.
- **Org Admin**: Oversees billing, manages team invites, enforces link policies, and upgrades plans.
- **Platform Super Admin**: Operates the template platform, monitors tenants, troubleshoots issues.

## 4. User Journey and Key Flows
1. **Discover**: Visitor lands on marketing page, understands value, and evaluates pricing.
2. **Sign Up & Onboard**: User signs up via email/password or Google, creates or joins an org, completes quick-start checklist.
3. **First Value**: User shortens a link, shares it, and sees early analytics trickle in.
4. **Adopt & Collaborate**: Org members invite teammates, configure custom domains (Pro), set link policies.
5. **Monetize**: Admin reaches plan limit, views paywall messaging, upgrades to Pro via Stripe checkout.
6. **Retain & Expand**: Org monitors analytics dashboard, receives usage insights and plan nudges, renews subscription.

## 5. Functional Requirements
### 5.1 Public Marketing Site
- Hero section with primary CTA (`Get Started`) and social proof.
- Features overview highlighting analytics, branded links, and collaboration.
- Pricing comparison (Free vs Pro) with feature checklist and upgrade CTAs.
- FAQ and footer with legal pages (privacy, terms).

### 5.2 Authentication & Onboarding
- Email/password registration with verification email.
- Google OAuth as optional expedited signup.
- Forgot/reset password flow.
- Support for belonging to multiple orgs with an org switcher.

- Audit log for critical actions (link delete, billing changes) visible to admins.

### 5.4 Link Shortener Module
- Form to create short link: long URL, optional custom slug, tags.
- Validate destination URL and slug uniqueness.
- Link list view with filters (by tag, creator, status) and quick search.
- Editable link settings: destination URL, slug, expiry date (Pro), custom domain (Pro), status (active/paused).
- Redirect service resolves short URL, logs click event, and forwards user.

### 5.5 Analytics & Reporting
- Per-link analytics: total clicks, unique visitors, devices, referrers, country (Pro for geo/referrer breakdown).
- Org-level dashboard: top links by clicks, usage over time, plan quota usage.
- Export CSV for link clicks (Pro) and shareable dashboard link (view-only).
- Email digest summarizing weekly performance (toggleable per org).

### 5.6 Billing & Subscription Management
- Stripe checkout for upgrade/downgrade, recurring billing, and payment method updates.
- Free plan caps: 10 active links per month, 1 org, no custom domain, basic analytics only.
- Pro plan benefits: unlimited links, up to 3 custom domains, advanced analytics, multiple orgs per user.
- In-app upgrade prompts when approaching plan limits; allow Admin to approve upgrade.
- Grace period handling for failed payments (7 days) before downgrading to Free.

### 5.7 Platform & Admin Tools
- Super Admin console: view org list, user count, plan status, usage metrics.
- Ability to impersonate an org (read-only) for support troubleshooting.
- System health dashboard (feature flags, background job status).

### 5.8 Integrations & Extensibility
- Webhook delivery for click events (Pro) to downstream marketing tools.
- API key generation for programmatic link creation (rate limited, Admin only).
- Modular architecture so the link module can be swapped; document extension points.

## 6. Data Model and Storage
- **User**: id, email, auth provider, profile metadata.
- **Organization**: id, name, slug, billing status, plan tier.
- **Membership**: user id, org id, role, status.
- **Link**: id, org id, creator id, destination url, slug, tags, expires_at, domain, status.
- **Click Event**: id, link id, timestamp, referrer, country, device, ip hash.
- **Subscription**: org id, plan, stripe customer id, renewal date, payment status.
- Retain click events for 18 months; archive older data to cold storage.

## 7. Analytics Instrumentation
- Track key events: `landing_cta_click`, `signup_started`, `signup_completed`, `org_created`, `link_created`, `link_shared`, `plan_limit_warning`, `plan_upgraded`.
- Monitor funnel conversion: visitor → signup → first link → first 10 clicks → upgrade.
- Dashboard KPIs: monthly active orgs, avg links/org, upgrade rate, churn, Wk1 retention.

## 8. Monetization Strategy
- Default billing cycle monthly; support annual billing with 2 months discount.
- In-app upgrade messaging triggered at 80% of free limit or when advanced analytics viewed.
- Send upgrade reminder emails at trial end or failed payment events; include Stripe customer portal link.
- Allow admins to cancel or downgrade via self-serve; capture cancellation reason.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
- Redirect endpoint latency <100ms p95 and >99.9% availability.
- Handle burst traffic of 100 requests/sec per org with auto-scaling edge function.
- Role-based access enforced at API and database layers.
- Logging, structured error tracking, and alerting for redirect failures and billing webhooks.
- GDPR-compliant data handling; provide data export/delete on request.
- Deployment ready for Vercel/Netlify with CI/CD pipeline and staging environment.

## 10. Success Metrics & Release Criteria
- 90% of new users create a link within 10 minutes of signup (instrument onboarding to measure).
- 80% of org admins complete billing setup when prompted by limits.
- Analytics dashboard displays click data within 5 minutes of events.
- Template consumers can swap the link shortener module for another feature within 2 developer days, validated by internal workshop feedback.

## 11. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Analytics latency or data loss. **Mitigation**: Queue-based ingestion with retries and monitoring.
- **Risk**: Stripe integration complexity. **Mitigation**: Use Billing Portal + prebuilt webhooks, include sandbox testing checklist.
- **Risk**: Feature bloat reduces template clarity. **Mitigation**: Keep advanced features behind Pro flag and document extension points.

## 12. Open Questions
- Should we bundle email sending (invites, digests) or lean on third-party integrations?
- Do we need workspace-level branding (logos, custom colors) for MVP?
- What localization strategy do we need beyond English for initial release?
