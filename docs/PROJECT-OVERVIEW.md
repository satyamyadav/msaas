# Modular SaaS Starter Kit

This repository houses the baseline implementation of the Modular SaaS starter kit. It follows the PRD goals of delivering an ejectable monolith on top of Next.js, complete with feature flagged modules and Prisma schema merging.

- **Status**: Foundational scaffolding complete (Next.js app, Tailwind theme, feature flag utilities, Prisma merge workflow).
- **Modules**: Auth and Stripe billing stubs wired into the router.
- **Next Steps**: Flesh out authentication flows, connect real billing providers, and expand the CLI automation from `docs/TASKS.md`.
